## About

I build software systems that process and understand clinical and pharmaceutical text. My current work focuses on parsing prescription instructions (SIG codes) with production-grade accuracy using finite state transducer architectures.

**Research Interests**
- Natural language processing for clinical text
- Medication instruction parsing and standardization
- UMLS and medical terminology systems
- Healthcare data interoperability

## Technical Background

**Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, SQL

**Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQLite, Prisma ORM

**Clinical Tools:** UMLS Metathesaurus, MetaMap, cTAKES

**Platforms:** Node.js, Linux, WSL

## Current Work

**Pharmaceutical SIG Parser**

A finite state transducer system for parsing prescription instructions into structured data. The parser processes medication directions like "Take 1 tablet by mouth twice daily as needed for pain" and extracts dose, route, frequency, interval, and conditional instructions.

- Validated against 44,592 prescription instructions
- Pattern-based extraction with conflict resolution
- Field independence architecture (frequency, interval, and boolean fields are parsed independently)
